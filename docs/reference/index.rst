MicroPython language and implementation
=======================================

MicroPython aims to implement the Python 3.4 standard (with selected
features from later versions) with respect to language syntax, and most
of the features of MicroPython are identical to those described by the
"Language Reference" documentation at
`docs.python.org <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html>`_.
