      This documentation is adapted from the official MicroPython project. 
      The CyberBrick team has extended the source code with custom interfaces 
      and features to our hardware and application needs.

    <p>
      In addition to these enhancements, certain built-in MicroPython interfaces have been 
      intentionally disabled to protect the system's integrity, and ensure the overall security and reliability of the device.
      This also facilitates content protection for creators' intellectual property, where applicable.

      Portions of the content are derived from the official MicroPython documentation and 
      have been included here under its open-source license to provide users with a consistent 
      and enriched development experience tailored to the CyberBrick platform.
